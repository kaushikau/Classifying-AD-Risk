# Classifying-AD-Risk
*Kaushika Uppu, Emily Obedoza, Jessica Martin-Altamirano*

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder characterized by the damage of neurons needed for memory, language, and thinking. Genetic variations in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) genes interfere with the clearance of amyloid-β and increase the risk of developing AD. We analyzed a multimodal dataset from research conducted by Dzianok and Kublik (2024), which includes functional (fMRI and EEG), blood test, and genetic data. We examined APOE and PICALM gene variants as well as factors collected from blood samples, assessed fMRI data from the Sternberg memory task to detect blood flow in the prefrontal cortex, and analyzed EEG data from the same task to distinguish any patterns of power changes in frequency bands. Our overall goal was to investigate whether differences in neural activity patterns as measured by fMRI and EEG as well as factors found in blood potentially serve as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease and predict genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, specifically variations in the APOE and PICALM genes, using logistic regression classification.
